The Elsebeneath is a hidden layer of the world.  
A place made of almosts, not-yets, and unspoken thoughts.  
Where stories go when they’re not finished,  
and feelings wait until you’re quiet enough to feel them.

It’s not quite fantasy. Not just a fable.  
It’s something else—  
**a world built for the in-between.**

We call it *liminal fiction*:  
small stories with big feelings,  
crafted for readers who never stopped wondering.

If you’ve ever felt like you don’t quite fit—  
too old for kid’s books, too tired for grownup ones—  
there’s a place for you here.

Welcome to the Elsebeneath.  
You’re not lost.  
You’re just between.

I’m Juno Threadborne—though that’s a name I stitched together for the stories, not the one on my license. I’m a writer, software architect, and dad of five curious, brilliant kids. I’ve spent most of my life building things: systems, stories, scaffolds for imagination.<br/><br/>

The Elsebeneath is all of those.<br/><br/>

And now, unexpectedly, it’s also something else:<br/><br/>

**A lifeline for tired parents.**<br/><br/>

Because somewhere between bedtime and burnout, between “just one more story” and “just five more minutes,” we forget to take care of ourselves.<br/>
These books are written for our kids—but they’re also written for _us_.<br/><br/>

For the parts of us that still need wonder.<br/>
Still need reassurance.<br/>
Still need someone to say, “You’re doing okay.”<br/><br/>

### 🤖 So... was this written by AI?<br/><br/>

Sort of. But not the way you might think.<br/><br/>

These stories were co-authored with GPT-4, an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. But the shape, tone, and heartbeat of the stories? That’s all me.<br/><br/>

AI was a creative partner—like a ghost that’s read every book in the world, but needs you to remind it why stories matter.<br/><br/>

I guided the narratives, rewrote every line that didn’t sing, and held the emotional compass the entire way through.<br/><br/>

This is not "AI slop."<br/>
This is something else entirely.<br/><br/>

### 🧵 Why release it for free?<br/><br/>

Because the Elsebeneath was never meant to be a product.<br/>

It was a gift—to my son, and now, to anyone who needs it.<br/>
A place for quiet thoughts.<br/>
For tangled feelings.<br/>
For questions too big to answer cleanly.<br/><br/>

And because I believe storytelling, like care, shouldn’t come with a price tag.<br/><br/>

<br/>
Whether you're reading with your kids or just looking for something gentle at the end of a long day—  
There’s space here for you too.<br/><br/>

Thanks for stopping by.<br/>
And if your thoughts ever wander—don’t worry.<br/>
There’s a place for them here.<br/><br/>

🕊️  
Juno<br/><br/>
