title: Welcome to the Elsebeneath
content: |
  A quiet collection of stories stitched from memory, wind, and what we almost said.

  Some were written for my son.  
  All were written to be shared.

  These are living drafts of lyrical fables. Best read slowly (or aloud). I revise in public. If you prefer straighter prose, start with “Kippen” or “Village.”
