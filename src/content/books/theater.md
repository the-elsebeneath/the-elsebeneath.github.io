_An Elsebeneath Story_
<br />
<br />

All Sam wanted was a ribbon. A simple one. But when the wind nudged him toward an old amphitheater with a name too long and a stage that blushes, he stepped into something else entirely: a play that won’t stay written.
<br />
<br />

Inside the Amphibio’théâtre, three actors are trapped in an endless rehearsal of a scene they can’t agree on—each remembering it differently, each holding a truth that contradicts the others. And at the heart of it all: a silence that never should have happened.
<br />
<br />

As the script rewrites itself, the props remember their lines, and the cue well sighs with withheld endings, Sam must do what he always hesitates to—speak. Because sometimes, the only way to make peace with the past… is to rewrite what was never said.
<br />
<br />

A story about memory, missteps, and the quiet power of being heard—even if you weren’t supposed to be in the scene at all.
