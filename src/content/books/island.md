_Book 1 of The Elsebeneath series_
<br />
<br />

This tender and whimsical tale takes readers on a journey through a magical island where those who feel "almost" good enough learn what it truly means to keep going.
<br />
<br />

When Sam’s yo-yo tricks won’t cooperate and self-doubt settles in, a mysterious turtle named Practicio invites him to explore a place filled with “Almosts”—a bird who never finished her song, a snail racing against impossible odds, a painter caught between creation and doubt, and a fearless kangaroo who falls but never quits.
<br />
<br />

Through enchanting stories and gentle wisdom, Sam discovers that imperfection is part of the journey, that “almost” is never the end, and that every small step forward is worth celebrating.
<br />
<br />

_Not every story is about mastery. Some are about courage, persistence, and the beauty of beginnings._
