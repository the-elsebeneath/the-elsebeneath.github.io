**The Island of Almosts**

_Book 1 of The Elsebeneath series_

This tender and whimsical tale takes readers on a journey through a magical island where those who feel "almost" good enough learn what it truly means to keep going.

When Sam’s yo-yo tricks won’t cooperate and self-doubt settles in, a mysterious turtle named Practicio invites him to explore a place filled with “Almosts”—a bird who never finished her song, a snail racing against impossible odds, a painter caught between creation and doubt, and a fearless kangaroo who falls but never quits.

Through enchanting stories and gentle wisdom, Sam discovers that imperfection is part of the journey, that “almost” is never the end, and that every small step forward is worth celebrating.

_Not every story is about mastery. Some are about courage, persistence, and the beauty of beginnings._
