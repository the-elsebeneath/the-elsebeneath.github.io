_A Brynn Story_
<br />
<br />

Brynn has baked the same celebration loaf since she was a child, using her grandmother’s timeworn recipe. But today, nothing turns out right. Four attempts in, the bread still slumps and mottles, as if it’s deliberately ignoring her. Determined to start over, Brynn is interrupted by a quiet customer who sees something worth saving in the imperfect loaf. His words, and the note he leaves behind, nudge Brynn toward a softer truth: that not everything needs to be flawless to be loved.
