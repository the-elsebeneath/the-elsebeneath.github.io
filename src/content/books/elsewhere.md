**Elsewhere, Brieflys**

_Book 6 of The Elsebeneath series_

This is a quirky, whimsical journey through a surreal, shifting part of the Elsebeneath where echoes, unfinished thoughts, and emotional missteps take center stage. Sam and his unpredictable companion Fen embark on a seemingly simple errand that quickly spirals into a series of absurd and metaphor-rich challenges—mispronunciations, emotional buffets, conversations with living objects, and refracted memories in endless mirrors.

The narrative plays with language, memory, and meaning as it explores how our internal “mistakes,” misunderstandings, and unfinished feelings shape who we are and what we carry forward. Doors judge intentions, ribbons hold unresolved regrets, and spoons change careers, all while the Elsebeneath folds, pivots, and pivots again around them.

At its core, the story is about embracing imperfection and ambiguity—about how meaning isn’t fixed, memory isn’t fact, and sometimes, the wrong answer or a misstep is exactly what’s needed to move forward. Along the way, they meet Graham, a timeless figure who reminds them that some memories come late, and all of them deserve to be met again.

Elsewhere, Briefly is a playful yet poignant meditation on emotional labor, the nature of remembrance, and the strange, winding routes we take through grief and healing—wrapped in humor, metaphor, and a touch of cosmic whimsy.
