*Book 6 of The Elsebeneath series*

Elsewhere, Briefly is a whimsical journey through a surreal part of the Elsebeneath where echoes, missteps, and unfinished thoughts take on lives of their own.
<br />
<br />


Sam and his unpredictable companion Fen set out on a simple errand that unravels into absurd, metaphor-rich challenges—mispronunciations, emotional buffets, conversations with living objects, and memories reflected in endless mirrors. Doors judge intentions, ribbons hold regrets, and spoons rethink their careers as the world folds and pivots around them.
<br />
<br />


Through playful chaos, the story explores how mistakes, misunderstandings, and unfinished feelings shape who we become. Along the way, they meet Graham, a timeless figure who reminds them that some memories arrive late—but all deserve to be met again.
<br />
<br />


At its heart, this book is about embracing imperfection and ambiguity—finding meaning in the wrong turns, and discovering that healing often happens in the places we least expect.
