*Book 3 of The Elsebeneath series*
<br />
<br />

Sam’s journey begins with a stubborn puzzle cube—mirroring his own struggle with doubt and persistence. When his backyard transforms into an ancient mountain carved with strange symbols, he realizes the climb itself is the true puzzle.
<br />
<br />

Guided by Practicio, a wise turtle who knows the mountain well, Sam faces a winding path filled with failed attempts, tempting shortcuts, and challenges that test more than skill. Along the way, he meets others—like a reclusive goat who quietly stacks stones, and Thimble, whose song reveals hidden paths—each showing a different side of the climb toward self-understanding.
<br />
<br />

At the summit, Sam finds no grand prize—only a quiet pool reflecting his growth. Mastery, he learns, isn’t perfection but the willingness to keep climbing and share what he’s built.
