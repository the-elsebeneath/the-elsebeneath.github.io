**The Mountain of Mastery**

_Book 3 of The Elsebeneath series_

Sam’s journey begins with a stubborn puzzle—an unsolved cube that mirrors his inner struggle with doubt and persistence. When the familiar backyard transforms into an ancient mountain carved with mysterious symbols, Sam realizes that the climb itself is the true puzzle, not the solution he’s been chasing.

Guided by Practicio, a wise and steady turtle who knows the climb’s hardships firsthand, Sam ascends the Mountain of Mastery—a winding, often lonely path marked by trinkets left by those who tried and paused, shrines of failed starts, and challenges that test more than just skill. Along the way, Sam confronts shortcuts that promise quick progress but ultimately lead nowhere, learning that true mastery requires patience, humility, and embracing the hard, slow parts.

Sam meets others on the mountain—like the reclusive goat who builds delicate stone towers alone, and Thimble, whose song unlocks hidden paths through darkness—each embodying different facets of the climb toward self-understanding and courage.

As the mountain narrows and the wind whispers doubts in his ear, Sam learns to face his fears, accept imperfection, and let go of rigid patterns. The summit offers no grand reward, only a quiet pool reflecting the weight he carries and the growth he’s made. There, Sam understands that mastery isn’t about solving the puzzle perfectly, but about continuing the climb with openness and readiness to share what he’s built.

In the end, the mountain isn’t just a place or a challenge—it’s a living metaphor for becoming, for carrying the unfinished, and for finding strength in the ongoing journey.
