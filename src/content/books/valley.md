_Book 2 of The Elsebeneath series_
<br />
<br />

Sam is back in the driveway, still chasing the yo-yo trick that won’t quite land. But this time, the journey leads him beyond frustration to a quiet valley where progress isn’t measured in speed or perfection—but in patience, presence, and the courage to keep walking without a guide.
<br />
<br />

Guided only by the steady ticking of an unseen clock, Sam meets a clockmaker inventing a new way to measure progress, a gardener tending seeds that bloom in their own time, a shadow that listens to doubt, and a star-gazing cat who reminds him that some things don’t show up when you try—they show up when you listen.
<br />
<br />

In this gentle and profound story, Sam learns that some journeys don’t end in mastery but in the quiet power of persistence—and that sometimes the most important step is simply the one you take next.
<br />
<br />

_For anyone who’s ever felt stuck, unsure, or almost there—this is a story about the space between trying and arriving._
