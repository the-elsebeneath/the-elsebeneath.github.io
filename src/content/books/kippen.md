_An Elsebeneath Interlude_
<br />
<br />

This quietly heartfelt story follows Kippen, a whisker-crooked kitten with a vest that’s always buttoned wrong and a grin that never quits—even when it probably should.
<br />
<br />

In the whimsical Village of Voicekeepers, where doors mutter memories and chimes whisper forgotten truths, Kippen is adored by all. Or at least, he thinks he is—until one morning, a smile flickers, a chime speaks out of turn, and something inside him stirs.
<br />
<br />

As he wanders the cobblestone streets with doubt in his paws and a compliment tucked in his pocket, Kippen begins to question whether the love he receives is for who he is… or just the mask he wears. But with the help of old friends, gentle ribbons, and one very honest baker, he learns that being seen—truly seen—is more beautiful than being perfect.
<br />
<br />

Sometimes, the bravest thing a heart can do is pause and ask: “Do they love the real me?”
<br />
