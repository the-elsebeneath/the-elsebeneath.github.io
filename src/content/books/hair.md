*A Said-So Academy Story*

A Hair Out of Place follows Fen as he stumbles through a painfully sincere emotional awakening—set against the precision-curated backdrop of Said-So Academy, where everything has its place... except maybe his feelings.
<br />
<br />

What begins as a simple observation (a single strand of hair refusing to stay put) spirals into a lunchroom quest, an unprepared declaration, and a graceful emotional crash landing. With Sam, his ever-skeptical friend, acting as both witness and reluctant lifeguard, Fen navigates the absurd intricacies of admiration, rejection, and the oddly sacred art of **caring out loud**.
<br />
<br />

Ms. Thomas—a too-wise, slightly chaotic teacher with thunderstorm energy—becomes the mirror Fen didn’t know he needed. But it’s not a love story. Not really. It’s a story about seeing someone, saying something brave, and surviving the quiet after.
<br />
<br />

Tender, witty, and a little bit unhinged, this story explores the bravery of being vulnerable before you know who you are, and the quiet victories that come from trying anyway.
