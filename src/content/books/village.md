_Book 4 of The Elsebeneath series_
<br />
<br />
Sam returns to a place where forgotten voices and half-heard thoughts weave the fabric of reality. Here, the wind doesn’t just carry sound—it carries meaning, memory, and sometimes, the weight of things left unsaid.
<br />
<br />

In the village square, chimes made of scraps and stories murmur with lost perspectives, echoing the gaps between words. Sam meets Fen, the boy who speaks in riddles and questions, and Tilda, the keeper of perspectives who teaches that clarity isn’t about loudness, but intention.
<br />
<br />

As old tensions flare and the Elsebeneath begins to fray, Sam and Fen learn the power of listening—not just to what’s spoken, but to what struggles to be heard. Together, they tune the voices of the village, discovering that understanding begins not with answers, but with the courage to ask better questions.
<br />
<br />

_In a world built from the echoes of what could have been, what does it mean to truly listen?_
