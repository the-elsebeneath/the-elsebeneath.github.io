      - "[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton designed by the late [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway#). It's a \"0-player game\" played out on a discretely mutating matrix of square, binary cells. The state of the each cell in the grid from one 'generation' (grid state) to the next is determined by the states of its 'neighbors' (immediately adjacent cells). For example, if a cell is 'alive' in the curent generation, and has more than 3 living neighbors, it will be dead in the next generation, as if by overpopulation."
