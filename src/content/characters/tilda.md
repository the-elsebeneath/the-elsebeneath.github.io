personalityArchetype: "The Caregiver / The Sage (in patchwork)"  
backstory: "Tilda has lived at the Shrine for as long as anyone can remember, cataloguing and tending to things others abandoned—yo-yos, sketches, socks, songs half-hummed.

Her own fabric, unspooling without end, may be her way of refusing to face her own unfinishedness."
