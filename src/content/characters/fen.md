  description: "A slim, battered volume Fen carries everywhere. He never opens it—not because he can’t, but because he insists the story inside is ‘still rehearsing.’ The book feels warm when he’s performing and cold when silence lingers too long."

# Character Details

characterType: "protagonist"  
personalityArchetype: "The Jester"  
backstory: "Fen showed up one evening in the Village square with a salute and a bow, as if the Elsebeneath itself had cast him in a role. No one knows where he came from, though he insists he was ‘hired by the season.’ His coat, several sizes too big, holds pockets full of nothing and everything: bent spoons, ribbon scraps, the occasional frog. He uses humor to bridge the gap between himself and others, even when he’s unsure if anyone wants him there at all."
