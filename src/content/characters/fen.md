  description: "A slim, battered volume Fen carries everywhere. He never opens itâ€”not because he canâ€™t, but because he insists the story inside is â€˜still rehearsing.â€™ The book feels warm when heâ€™s performing and cold when silence lingers too long."

# Character Details

characterType: "protagonist"  
personalityArchetype: "The Jester"  
backstory: "Fen showed up one evening in the Village square with a salute and a bow, as if the Elsebeneath itself had cast him in a role. No one knows where he came from, though he insists he was â€˜hired by the season.â€™ His coat, several sizes too big, holds pockets full of nothing and everything: bent spoons, ribbon scraps, the occasional frog. He uses humor to bridge the gap between himself and others, even when heâ€™s unsure if anyone wants him there at all."
