backstory: "Vel was a muu in ancient timesâ€”a mourner-dancer who moved through funeral rites not as wound but as ritual. She translated grief for those who had no language for their pain. When she arrived in the Elsebeneath, she gave away pieces of herself to help others, including her name to Gable. She lived as Vel the cat, helping others carry their burdens until she almost dissolved entirely. Through Sam's presence and care, she remembered that she could reclaim what she had given away."
