**Juno Threadborne** is a speculative and absurdist fiction writer exploring the threshold between technology, memory, and human connection. His work blurs genres and mediums—ranging from lyrical sci-fi to Slack-based operettas. He collaborates closely with AI, not as a tool but as a creative partner, crafting stories that feel like they’re being written by a chorus of voices past, present, and possible. Juno’s narratives are woven from threads of grief and wonder, logic and metaphor—and always, always hope.
